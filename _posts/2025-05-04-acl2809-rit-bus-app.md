# Ritchie's Bus Schedule: Eager loading for the welcome image
For my contribution, I'm contributing to Ritchie's Bus Schedule. I'm
contributing to this software because it's something I use personally, so it
makes sense for me to contribute to it.
## Introduction to the Community
[Ritchie's Bus Schedule](https://www.rit-bus.app/) is a community-made bus
schedule, that is a better version of the official website. It's important that
this exists because the buses at RIT are inconsistent, and the existing website
is hard to use.

This project was a good pick based on what I learned from the Comm Arch
experience. There seems to be an active community, and good tests and
documentation, as well as a good community.

## The issue
I chose this issue
[#109](https://github.com/hiromon0125/ritchie-bus-schedule/issues/109) because
it was marked as a good first issue, which is correct, it was not difficult to
reproduce, and had a simple fix. The welcome image is loaded lazily, which is
bad for performance. Because it's above the fold, it'll be displayed
immediately, so lazy loading will make it take longer for the whole page to do
it's first render.

Looking at the issue description, I quickly determined a possible solution to
the problem based on the documentation for the Next.js Image:
```diff

           <div className=" h-3 w-full bg-linear-to-b from-[#e1ecf7] to-[#e1ecf700]" />
```
After writing this solution, I ran the lighthouse performance test again, and
found that I had significantly improved the performance compared to before, so
I submitted a PR for it, which then got merged.
![A GitHub PR. I comment "For #109 It might also be a good idea to eagerly load the map too, but I don't know if it'll make as big of a difference because it might not be on the screen. hiromon0125 comments "oh i just merged without properly reviewing it lol, but this is good."](../assets/images/acl2809/pr.png)
