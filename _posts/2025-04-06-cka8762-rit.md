## What I contributed to?
I contributed to the open source app for rit buses, Ritchie's Bus Schedule. An open source app that focuses on helping RIT students navigate the bus schedule easier to 
navigate. 

## Why I choose it
I wanted to contribute to something that I use, even if its every so often. I always found myself looking at the official rit bus site and struggling to read through
the schedule that they layout. When this class first introduced me to it I swapped over to using [rit-bus.app](rit-bus.app), which was easier to read. I find it more
satisfying to contribute to an app that not only I use, but hopefully other rit students.

## The Contribution
Since the app itself, as far as I can tell, runs fairly clean so I didn't immediately find any glaring bugs. I used the app for a couple weeks, doing a combination of 
limit testing and just general app use, I still found no glaring bugs. There are some differences between the mobile and desktop versions of the websites, but those 
are intentional experimental or design choices. After taking a look at the issues, I was a little overwhelmed with making code changes.

Instead I decided to make a feature suggestion. While I was using the app, I only have the 1 apex bus favorited. When on desktop I felt like there was a lot of dead space
in the favorited section that could be used to display more information.

I suggested that the space should be filled with another part of the website, the time Table. Each bus has a time table for each stop that they pick/drop off students.
